The data inside this folder is the amplification factor from 100m waterdepth.

Each file contains a list of amplification factors (2nd column) for a given set of wave periodes (1st column, given in seconds). You may interpolate between known values to find the amplification factor for a given wave periode.

The file profiles.jpg shows the 7 different profiles.

The name of the data files: p[1-7] is which profile the data is for, and neg/pos is for leading depression (which we decided to use in the project) and leading preak.
